Warns you when you call a method that will throw an exception right away.
<!-- tooltip end -->
The following snippet shows the purpose of the inspection.
It will highlight the second method call that is actually not supported for this object.

This inspection is not very stable and will miss some cases. Like when IDEA is not able to determine precise class type for the inspection to analyze the method implementation.

<pre>
class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MalformedAbstraction normal = new NormalImplementation();
        normal.doSomething(); // Works flawlessly

        MalformedAbstraction broken = new IncompleteImplementation();
        broken.doSomething(); // Suddenly throws exception, but you'll probably know this only at runtime.
    }
}

interface MalformedAbstraction {
    void doSomething();
}

class NormalImplementation implements MalformedAbstraction {
    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        // Computes something
    }
}

class IncompleteImplementation implements MalformedAbstraction {
    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("There might be a class has this method working");
    }
}
